# How to Add Your Own Images

## Instructions:

1. **Add JPG files** to this folder (`public/images/`)
2. **Name them exactly** as listed below (case-sensitive)
3. **Restart the development server** (`npm run dev`) to see changes

## Expected Image Files:

- `dax.jpg` - Will be named "Dax" (the main user)
- `alex.jpg` - Will be named "Alex"
- `sarah.jpg` - Will be named "Sarah"
- `mike.jpg` - Will be named "Mike"
- `emma.jpg` - Will be named "Emma"
- `james.jpg` - Will be named "James"
- `lisa.jpg` - Will be named "Lisa"
- `david.jpg` - Will be named "David"
- `anna.jpg` - Will be named "Anna"
- `tom.jpg` - Will be named "Tom"

## Notes:

- Images should be JPG format
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger
- Images will be automatically cropped to square format
- If an image file is missing, the app will show the default colored avatar
- You can have fewer than 10 images - the app will work with whatever you provide

## Example:

If you have a photo of your friend John, save it as `john.jpg` and update the code to include `john.jpg` in the imageNames array.
